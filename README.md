 Edge Detection Using Canny and Sobel in Computer Vision

This GitHub repository contains a computer vision project focused on edge detection. Edge detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to identify boundaries or edges between different objects or regions in an image.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an edge detection algorithm that can accurately detect edges in digital images. The repository includes the necessary code, datasets, and documentation to understand and reproduce the project.
Features

The main features of this project are:

    Edge Detection Algorithms: The repository provides implementation and evaluation of popular edge detection algorithms such as Canny, Sobel, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), and more. Each algorithm is implemented in a modular and reusable manner.

    Image Preprocessing: In order to improve the accuracy of edge detection, the project includes image preprocessing techniques like smoothing, noise reduction, and gradient calculation.


Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/edge-detection-project.git

    Install the required dependencies. This project may require specific computer vision libraries or frameworks like OpenCV, NumPy, or scikit-image. Consult the documentation for the specific requirements and installation instructions.

    Explore the src directory to access the implementation of different edge detection algorithms.

    Review the documentation to understand the theory behind each algorithm, their usage, and the recommended parameter settings.

    Use the provided dataset or include your own images to test the edge detection algorithms. Ensure that the images are appropriately preprocessed and organized.

    Run the edge detection algorithms on your chosen images and evaluate their performance using the provided evaluation metrics.

    Experiment with different algorithms, parameter settings, or even propose your own modifications to enhance the edge detection results.
